In this file I want to explain why I am using this design.

1. Firstly, I need to explain about RMT so I have loaded information about RMT on the home screen of the project and in the nav bar I have divided it into 2 parts(RMT and Products) so that users can easily navigate on any of the options.

2. So, In the first screen is about RMT, how does it work and what exactly RMT is.

3. In the second screen there is a list of products. So I have created a card for each product which contains the name and description of products.

4. When the user clicks on any of the products or on the card then the user gets redirected to repository details and completes product details.

5. I have used bootstrap cards to show products and their repositories because I don't have many details so I have used only names and descriptions to show which they look good in cards.
