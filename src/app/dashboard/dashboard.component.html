                        <p> It's a tool that allows to mirror SUSE products and their repositories in a private
                            network.Usually SUSE client systems register their products directly with scc.suse.com, but
                            in
                            many customer scenarios it's not possible for clients to reach the internet, hence we offer
                            RMT
                            as an on-site proxy to be used as registration host and repository mirror.</p>
                        <p>The Repository Mirroring Tool (RMT) for SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP2 allows enterprise
                            customers
                            to optimize the management of SUSE Linux Enterprise software updates and subscription
                            entitlements. It establishes a proxy system for SUSEÂ® Customer Center with repositories and
                            registration targets. This helps you to centrally manage software updates within a firewall
                            on a
                            per-system basis, while maintaining your corporate security policies and regulatory
                            compliance.

                                and retrieve updates for bandwidth or security reasons.</li>
                            <li>There are SUSE Linux Enterprise hosts that are restricted and difficult to update
                                without
                                putting in place a custom update management solution.</li>

                            <p>To install it during installation, select the rmt-server package. The package selection
                                is available in the Installation Settings step of the installation when selecting
                                Software.</p>
                            <p>
                                We recommend to check for available RMT updates immediately after installing SUSE Linux
                                Enterprise Server using the zypper patch command. SUSE continuously releases maintenance
                                updates for RMT, and newer packages are likely to be available.
